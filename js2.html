      <h2> Midnight Voyage</h2>
      <p>The sea was a mirror of obsidian beneath the silver light of the moon. A lone boat, The Seraphine, drifted quietly across the still waters, her white sail glowing like a ghost in the night. Captain Elias stood at the helm, eyes scanning the horizon. There were no stars—only clouds swirling like slow smoke above, threatening to swallow the moon.

All around, silence reigned, broken only by the gentle slap of water against the hull. The crew had long since gone below deck, lulled into sleep by the rhythmic rocking of the sea. But Elias stayed awake. He always did.

Tonight marked the anniversary of the night his brother vanished at sea, aboard this very boat. Some said he’d drowned in a storm. Others whispered of a curse. Elias believed neither. He believed the sea held secrets, and tonight, he meant to find them.

As the boat passed into deeper waters, the compass began to spin. The wind shifted without warning. Elias tightened his grip. Mist curled over the water, and the temperature dropped. Out of the fog came a faint melody—an eerie hum, like a lullaby sung through time.

Suddenly, lights flickered on the waves. Shapes. Lanterns. Another ship, ancient and black, rose from the mist, gliding silently toward The Seraphine. On its deck stood a figure, drenched and pale.

Elias whispered, "Jonah?"

The figure raised its hand. The sea stilled. Then, just as quickly, the phantom ship dissolved into the fog, leaving only ripples.

Elias stood frozen, tears on his cheeks. He didn’t know if what he saw was real—but he did know the sea had answered.

At dawn, the boat returned to course. But Elias knew something had changed.

The voyage wasn’t over.
It had just begun.
